# Intro to Computing for New Economics Research Assistants

Hello!

This is a guide for new research assistants (RAs) in Economics, based on things I've learned in my time as an RA. Specifically, this guide focuses on using automation effectively to become more productive, and should be useful beyond Economics. This aims to be comprehensive, but does not claim to be authoritative. These techniques have worked well for me; some may work well for you too.
