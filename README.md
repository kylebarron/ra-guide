# ra-guide
A guide for incoming research assistants

Very unfinished. There are some helpful files within the `src/` directory
though.

If you have `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` installed (`pip install mkdocs
mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions`) you can also view this documentation as a
website by running
```
mkdocs serve
```
and going to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
